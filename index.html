      Contessa</font> </i></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">was built
      by Jeremy Rogers in 1978, to the modified 'U' shape galley layout. She was
      one of the first boats to have the headlining made from the new mold. <b><i>Vagabond</i></b>
      has had two previous owners, one from new until 1988, its second owner from
      1988 until September 2003. During this time the boat was maintained at the
      Agamemnon Yard at Bucklers Hard, on the Beaulieu River. The boat has never
      been subject to competitive racing. Since I took ownership in 2003 I have
      steadily completed a very extensive refit at a cost of well in excess of
      &pound;16,000, with a view to some very serious blue water sailing, the
      result being that <i><font size="3"><b>Vagabond Contessa</b></font></i>
      is a fine example of the well established classic Contessa 32, to which
      most other boats are compared. All the improvements have been made with
      the original design in mind and little has been changed from the original
      concept. The boat has been wintered ashore with the cockpit covered, since
      2003 and last year (2008) she was not launched. The boat is ready to sail
      away with no further attention. The following specification highlights the
      major renewals/replacements but many other smaller items of a general nature
      have been undertaken.</font></td>

        seat, which converts into a double bunk when used with the
        very substantial, large, folding table; opposite which is a
        long bunk. To the stern of the saloon is the galley (port) and
